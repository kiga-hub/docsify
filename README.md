## Introduction to Docsify

Docsify is a tool for dynamically generating documentation websites. What sets it apart from GitBook and Hexo is that it doesn't generate .md files into .html files; instead, all the conversion work happens at runtime.

This makes it very handy if you simply need to quickly set up a small documentation website or if you don't want the generated bunch of .html files to clutter your commit history. With Docsify, you can just create an index.html file, start writing your documentation, and deploy it directly on GitHub Pages.

## Local Deployment:
